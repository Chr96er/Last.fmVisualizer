# Last.fmVisualizer

The Last.fmVisualizer application plots a user's top tags, artists, albums, and tracks as sunburst charts, using the last.fm API. For Artist, Artist-Album, and Artist-Track charts a contextmenu allows access to the selected element's Spotify and Last.fm link. Insert a last.fm user name or select a friend to get started.

<b>Note:</b> Since 29/05/17 Spotify requires access tokens to all Web API Endpoints. Spotify integration is therefore not possible until further notice.
